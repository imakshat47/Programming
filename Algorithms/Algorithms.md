## üß© Understanding Algorithms

An **algorithm** is a precise, step-by-step procedure to solve a problem or perform a computation efficiently.  
Every algorithm in this repository follows a consistent structure: problem definition ‚Üí pseudocode ‚Üí implementation ‚Üí complexity analysis.

Each implementation also includes:
- **Comments and docstrings** describing logic  
- **Example use cases**  
- **Comparative notes** between iterative and recursive approaches
